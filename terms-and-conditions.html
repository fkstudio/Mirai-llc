Further, the company holds no liability for damages so incurred by any third parties.</p>
						<!-- Clause 18: Defect Liability -->

						<p>2. In the extremely rare event that breakdown or other such damages occur as a result of criminal intent or gross negligence on the part of the company, the company will pay all repair and compensatory costs involved, regardless of the rules stipulated in (1) above.</p>
